🧠 Prompt Engineering Approach:
Strategic Design Philosophy
My prompt engineering strategy focuses on reliability, scalability, and business value - key requirements for enterprise AI deployment.

1. Two-Stage Intent Classification
Stage 1: Precise Intent Detection

python
intent_prompt = """
Classify this message into ONE intent:
- make_reservation: wants to book a table
- modify_reservation: wants to change booking  
- cancel_reservation: wants to cancel booking
- restaurant_recommendation: wants restaurant suggestions
- general_info: asking about restaurants

Message: "{user_message}"
Respond with only the intent name.
"""
Key Engineering Decisions:

Temperature 0.1: Ensures consistent classification

Single-word responses: Eliminates hallucination risk

Mutually exclusive categories: Prevents classification ambiguity

Business-aligned intents: Maps directly to revenue-generating actions

2. Context-Aware Response Generation
Stage 2: Dynamic Context Injection

python
system_prompt = """
You are FoodieBot for FoodieSpot restaurant chain.

Available Restaurants: {restaurant_data}
User Context: {conversation_history}

Guidelines:
- Prioritize revenue-generating suggestions
- Confirm all reservation details before booking
- Upsell complementary services when appropriate
- Maintain brand voice: friendly, professional, food-enthusiastic
"""
3. Advanced Prompt Optimization Techniques
Business-Driven Prompt Design:

Role-Based Personas: Clear system identity as "FoodieBot"

Dynamic Data Injection: Real-time restaurant availability

Conversation Memory: Context preservation across interactions

Error Recovery: Graceful handling of API failures

Compliance Safeguards: Prevents hallucinated restaurant information

Technical Implementation:

Token Optimization: Efficient context management for cost control

Fallback Hierarchies: Multiple response strategies for reliability

A/B Testing Ready: Modular prompts for performance optimization
